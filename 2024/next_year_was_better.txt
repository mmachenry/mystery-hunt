Definitely practice more with constraint solvers in Clojure and Haskell
at least to have a couple of options.

Roman Numerals should be in the spreadsheets. They are actually. 

There should be a Google Editor Addon for the sheets functions. Talk to
Ruven and Amber about how they want to add those things together.

I'm still too slow at writing code.

Can we make a cross word visual in google addons?

"Is this a word in a very liberal dictionary" function for google sheets

I was asked for a long-string anagrammer. Internet services for this
sometimes don't do multiword and sometimes have character limits. We should
also be able to input special dictionaries.

Perhaps collect a set of dictionaries ahead of time.
